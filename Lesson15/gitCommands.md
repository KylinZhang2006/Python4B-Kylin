### Common Git Commands
Before you make any changes, remember to use:
```
git pull
```
After you make changes, add all the changed files:
```
git add .
```
or add a specific file:
```
git add Lesson14/vehicle.py
```
And then commit the changes with a message:
```
git commit -m "just a message."
```
Last step, push your commits to remote:
```
git push
```

You can always use the following command to check the current status and decide what to do next:
```
git status
```
